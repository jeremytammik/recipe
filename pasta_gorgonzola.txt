Quick And Simple: Pasta With Gorgonzola
 
Ingredients

6 ounces dried pasta, whatever shape you like best, or fettuccine
1 clove garlic, thinly sliced
4 ounces Gorgonzola, crumbled in large pieces
2 tablespoons your best butter, cut in pieces
2 to 4 tablespoons cream
Sea salt and freshly ground pepper
Parmigiano-Reggiano, to grate over all

Directions

Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta. While it is heating, set a bowl large enough to hold the cooked pasta over the pot and add the garlic, cheese, butter, and cream. As the water heats, everything will become warm and soft.

Remove the bowl when the water comes to a boil. Add plenty of salt to the pot, then the pasta, and give it stir. Cook until the pasta is as done as you like it, then scoop it out and add it directly to the bowl. The heat of the pasta will melt any lumps of cheese that havenâ€™t melted yet.

Toss everything together with freshly cracked pepper, and transfer to warm pasta plates. Grate a little Parmigiano-Reggiano over each plate and serve.
