juice of 1 lemon

some sesame seeds, optionally roasted

2009-12-13 at nick and alison's, turned out really well:

500 g dried chick peas, soaked over night and boiled for an hour
3 small and very juicy lemons
6 big fat cloves of garlic
8 big tablespoons tahini
10 tablespoons olive oil
salt

giannalisa says that the tahini should be mixed with some water before using it, creating a creamy smooth emulsion.
