Tiramisu

        make

 20 cl  really strong espresso coffee, the big machine for six cups full.

        separate

  3     eggs into the yolk and the white.
        whip the egg white stiff in a narrow tall bowl.

        mix the egg yolk with

100  g  powder sugar or better still honey
 10 cl  amaretto 

        to a thick cream.
        maybe if you warm the mixture carefully in a water bath 
        while mixing it, or after layering the tiramisu in the bowl,
        it will coagulate slightly and create a stiffer tiramisu in the end.

        add

500  g  mascarpone.
        carefully add the stiffly whipped egg white.

        prepare

200  g  ladyfingers, aka loeffelbiscuit 

        roll the biscuits on a plate full of coffee.
        ensure they are well soaked yet not soggy.
        maybe the heat of the coffee in the biscuits will 
        help the egg-mascarpone cream coagulate a little?

        leave to cool.

        sieve cocoa over the top just before serving, 
        not before, or it will go dull.

test spicing the coffee with cardamom, and the mascarpone cream with chili and ginger.

2021-06-26:

didn't separate the eggs.
just mixed 3 eggs, sugar, chili powder and 500 g mascarpone into a thick cream.
made coffee in the medium pot, that was not enough.
pre-heated the tiramisu form and a flat dinnerplate for rolling the ladyfingers with boiling water.
used only ca. 130 g of ladyfingers due to lack of coffee.
so, it would have been better to use 1 kg of mascarpone, 6 eggs and the super large coffee pot.
turned out great, though.

2022-03-26:

didn't separate the eggs.
mixed 113 g sugar, 1 hot chili, 3 eggs, 500 g mascarpone, quite a lot of cheap amaretto from norma.
made coffee in the large pot.
pre-heated the tiramisu form and a flat dinnerplate for rolling the ladyfingers with boiling water.
used ca. 155 g of ladyfingers (19 out of 24 = 200 g) due to lack of space and tiramisu covering cream.
turned out great.

2022-08-12 for karen's birthday:

made coffee in the large pot.
mixed 105 g brown sugar, 1 hot chili 17 g, 3 unseparated eggs, 500 g mascarpone, quite a lot of good disaronna amaretto 61 g.
pre-heated the tiramisu form and a flat dinnerplate for rolling the ladyfingers with boiling water.
