felix loves it as well.

totally overdose on lemon and sugar.

yum, yum.

100 g butter
150 g brown sugar
1 lemon grated rind + juice
1 egg
100 g self-raising flour can be whole meal

grease and line the base of an 18 cm tin
heat the butter and 120 g of sugar over gentle heat until the butter is melted
take off the heat and stir in the lemon rind
whisk the egg in a basin
whisk it into the sugar mixture
fold in the flour
turn the mixture into the tin
bake at 180 degrees centigrade for about 30 minutes until just firm to the touch
warm the remaining 30 grams of sugar with the lemon juice
prick the cake all over (lots of holes) (you can also use a toothpick) and spoon the syrup over the cake
leave it in the tin to cool
