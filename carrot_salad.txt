Moroccan Carrot Salad

Ingredients

2 pounds peeled baby carrots
1 cup sultanas
1 1/2 cups toasted sliced almonds
2 lemons
2 tablespoons honey
6 tablespoons almond oil
2 tablespoons rose water
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
salt and pepper

Instructions

Place the raisins in a pyrex cup or coffee mug. Add water to cover and microwave 2 min. Let raisins plump while you prepare the rest of the salad.

Scrub, zest, and juice the lemons. Blend the lemon juice, lemon zest, honey, oil, rose water, and cinnamon. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.

Load the baby carrots lengthwise into the feed tube of the food processor with the shredding disk in place and shred in batches.

Drain the raisins and combine in a bowl with the shredded carrots, almonds, and dressing, and toss. Cover and place in the refrigerator for at least one hour to marinate before serving.
