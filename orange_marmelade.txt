2018-04-05 -- my first attempt ever:

2.1 kg oranges (6 big ones)
650 g sugar
1.2 teaspoons agar-agar

cut the unpeeled oranges very fine, max 6 x 6 mm bits of peel
boil them gently
mix the agara-agar with the sugar and add to the oranges
pour into sterilised glass jars

result: taste is absolutely perfect; moni thinks it is a bit too roughly shredded.

idea for next time: pour half the result into glasses as is, roughly cut; retain the other half, blend it (purierstab, purieren), and then finish fill the glasses with that.

2020-01-04 -- second try:

2 kg bio blood oranges from rewe
500 g sugar
1 tablespoon agar-agar

12 medium sized oranges
no need to clean, peel or wash them in any way
just remove any pips that you happen to come across
7 cut up very fine, entire, with peel and everything, 6 mm squares
5 thrown into the blender
boil gently
add sugar and agar-agar
pour into sterilised glass jars
