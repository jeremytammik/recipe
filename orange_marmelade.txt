2018-04-05 -- my first attempt ever:

2.1 kg oranges (6 big ones)
650 g sugar
1.2 teaspoons agar-agar

cut the unpeeled oranges very fine, max 6 x 6 mm bits of peel
boil them gently
mix the agara-agar with the sugar and add to the oranges
pour into sterilised glass jars

result: taste is absolutely perfect; moni thinks it is a bit too roughly shredded.

idea for next time: pour half the result into glasses as is, roughly cut; retain the other half, blend it (purierstab, purieren), and then finish fill the glasses with that.
