5-Ingredient Whisky Dark Chocolate Truffles

4 servings

400 grams dark chocolate (finely chopped, or chocolate chips)
80 ml heavy cream
2 tbsp. butter
80 ml whisky
1 tsp. sea salt
unsweetened cocoa powder (optional, or sprinkles for rolling)

Add chocolate, heavy cream and butter to a medium saucepan.
Heat over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth.
Stir in whisky and sea salt, and whisk until smooth.
Refrigerate the mixture for 2-3 hours, or until completely chilled.

Remove from the refrigerator, and use a small cookie scoop (or a melon baller or spoon) to shape the truffles into your desired size and shape, rolling between your hands quickly to smooth out the edges into a ball if needed.
Roll each ball in a bowl of cocoa powder or sprinkles if desired.

Enjoy immediately, or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 1 week.
