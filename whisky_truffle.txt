5-Ingredient Whisky Dark Chocolate Truffles

4 servings

400 grams dark chocolate (finely chopped, or chocolate chips)
80 ml heavy cream
2 tbsp. butter
80 ml whisky
1 tsp. sea salt
unsweetened cocoa powder (optional, or sprinkles for rolling)

Add chocolate, heavy cream and butter to a medium saucepan.
Heat over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth.
Stir in whisky and sea salt, and whisk until smooth.
Refrigerate the mixture for 2-3 hours, or until completely chilled.

Remove from the refrigerator, and use a small cookie scoop (or a melon baller or spoon) to shape the truffles into your desired size and shape, rolling between your hands quickly to smooth out the edges into a ball if needed.
Roll each ball in a bowl of cocoa powder or sprinkles if desired.

Enjoy immediately, or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 1 week.

first attempt, wich amaretto:

130 g dark chocolate, over 75% cocoa
140 ml cream (haltbare H-sahne)
40 ml amaretto disaronno

heat the chocolate in a pan in boiling water.
mix the cream with the amaretto and pour into the chocolate.
i made two small batches.
the first, poured into ice cube forms, is lighter and more liquid.
the second, scraped off more hot chocolate from the walls of the pan and mixed more, is darker and more solid.
left them to cool in the open, no fridge.
we ate the first batch next day, still uncooled, with spoons.
